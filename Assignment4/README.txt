Question - 1

The linear regression equation is:

class =

     -0.1084 * CRIM +
      0.0458 * ZN +
      2.7187 * CHAS=1 +
    -17.376  * NOX +
      3.8016 * RM +
     -1.4927 * DIS +
      0.2996 * RAD +
     -0.0118 * TAX +
     -0.9465 * PTRATIO +
      0.0093 * B +
     -0.5226 * LSTAT +
     36.3411

=== Summary ===

Correlation coefficient                  0.8528
Mean absolute error                      3.1897
Root mean squared error                  4.4629
Relative absolute error                 53.574  %
Root relative squared error             53.3441 %
Total Number of Instances              101    


2 of the attributes are ommitted in the final equation which are AGE, INDUS. These 2 attributes can be either highly postive correalted or highly negative correalted with other attributes, so they might be ommitted from the final equation. High coefficient of RM attribute indicates it is highly affecting the output.

    -0.8249 * sex=I +
     0.0577 * sex=M +
    -0.4583 * length+
    11.0751 * diameter +
    10.7615 * height +
     8.9754 * whole_weight +
   -19.7869 * shucked_weight +    
	-10.5818 * viscera_weight +
     8.7418 * shell_weight +
	 3.8946


Question - 3
